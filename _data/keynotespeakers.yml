  subject: 20:20 - The History and Future of OWASP
  abstract: 20 years ago I was moderating the webappsec mailing list on securityfocus and had just started a new job running application security at Charles Schwab, when the CIO came running down down the hall demanding to speak to the new guy. He wanted to know why we were in the Wall Street Journal and what I was going to do about it. I felt like I had been framed. After fending off ambulance chasers and wading through marketing “bull shiitake” from vendors, I realized there was a gap that needed to be filled. OWASP was born. No real plan, no real goal, armed with just a belief that the world needed better information I sent out a call to action for like-minded people to get involved. The rest as they say is history. Looking back it’s been an amazing success story of a community that has had a significant positive impact on the world during a time when development technology and the threat landscape has changed beyond recognition.  What was critical to OWASPs success and how should it evolve over the next 20 years? We will take a walk down memory lane, star gaze into the future and leave with an updated call to action for the next twenty years.

Chris started his professional application security journey in 2000 at the pioneering security consultancy @stake where he was VP of Research. Following on with his research in static analysis he founded Veracode with Christien Rioux in 2006. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in computer & systems engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He is also the author of "The Art of Software Security Testing" published by Addison-Wesley.</p>
  subject: "AppSec: from Outsiders to Allies"
  abstract: AppSec roots began with late 90’s vulnerability research and the ultimate technology outsiders, hackers. Microsoft didn’t even want to touch application security until customers threatened to stop buying over the monthly worms of the early 2000’s. Then the threat space changed and attacks weren’t for just done for fun, but done by criminal gangs and nation states. Critical bugs were monetized in the millions of dollars and led to national level security events. In 2021 there is a realization that the security of the software the government purchases has a lot to do with how secure the government is. Now almost every development team needs some AppSec and they want it tightly embedded in their development process. This talk will discuss how we got here and how we need to work as allies with the software development team.
